# Big data files - not tracked in Git
This folder contains all the large data files (any over 100k) that are not tracked in the 
`World_AIMS_Marine-sat-imagery` dataset Git repository. This includes the generated
satellite imagery, preview maps, presentations, etc. These are available for download here.

To get a full working copy of the dataset, clone the Git repository and download all the files
in this folder and save it as `World_AIMS_Marine-sat-imagery\big-files` in the repository.
This way you will be able to rerun the image generation scripts.

## Publication note
All the files in this directory are ignored in the Git repository. The contents of this folder
should be published as a public folder for download on NextCloud.
