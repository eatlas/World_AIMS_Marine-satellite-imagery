# Big data files - not tracked in Git
This folder contains all the large data files (any over 100k) generated from the code in the [World_AIMS_Marine-satellite-imagery](https://github.com/eatlas/World_AIMS_Marine-satellite-imagery)) code repository. This includes the generated satellite imagery, preview maps, presentations, etc. These are available for download here.

To get a full working copy of the dataset, clone the Git repository and download all the files
in this folder and save it as `World_AIMS_Marine-sat-imagery\big-files` in the repository.
This way you will be able to rerun the image generation scripts.

## Publication note
All the files in this directory are ignored in the Git repository. The contents of this folder
should be published as a public folder for download on NextCloud.

## Changelog
The purpose of this change log is to track how in sync the big-files are in sync with the 
main code base. A new changelog entry should be added each time the files in the `big-files`
directory is updated or added for download. This can then be compared with the versioning 
and dates of the source code.
