This area contains one folder per project. The idea is that each project specifies the image sets that they used. In this way the code is more reproducible. 

# Projects
## default
The `default` project corresponds to a collection of most of the best imagery from the other project. The resulting imagery is not published due to its size, but we retain a record of the image sets here.

## marb - Mapping Australian Marine Boundaries
This corresponds to the manual imagery prepared for the NESP MaC 3.17 project. In this project we use fully automated image selection in a different dataset (INSERT REFERENCE) and manually created images in select areas (this dataset).
